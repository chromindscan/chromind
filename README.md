# Chromia as a Transparent AI Database

This project provides a web server that logs all OpenAI API requests and responses, storing them securely on the Chromia blockchain database. By capturing and recording interactions with OpenAI's models on a transparent and immutable ledger, this project aims to enhance the transparency and accountability of AI agents.

To integrate it, simply run the server and update 4-lines of your OpenAI code.

## The Need for Transparency in AI
We've seen many Crypto x AI Agent projects that position themselves as "AI-powered trading & meme-ing" solutions without providing any proof of their AI capabilities. This project leverages blockchain technology to store all AI interactions on-chain in real-time, making them verifiable by anyone.
