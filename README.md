# Chromia as a Transparent AI Database

## The Need for Transparency in AI
How do we know if those viral "AI trading" accounts are actually using AI? Most Crypto x AI projects claim to use AI for trading and meme generation, but provide zero proof. This project solves that by recording all AI interactions on-chain, making them publicly verifiable.

## Introduction

 Chromia as a Transparent AI Database is a web server that logs all AI model interactions (OpenAI, Ollama, OpenRouter) onto Chromia's blockchain, creating a verifiable record of AI activities. Integration requires just 4 lines of code.

To integrate it, simply run the server and update 4-lines of your OpenAI code. It supports OpenAI, Ollama, OpenRouter (I've tested these so far!)
